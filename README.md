~~Had to make this because firefox doesn't support search in youtube like in chrome~~
**[IT DOES!!] (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1177556)** ðŸ¤—

### How to use
1. pm2 start index.js --watch
2. go to [localhost:3000/yt/your search query](http://localhost:3000/yt/your+search+query)
3. that's it !ðŸ˜Š
